1. üîç**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into a website to be executed or displayed on a user's device.  
2. This vulnerability is often exploited to steal user data, perform phishing attacks, or compromise user accounts on trusted websites.


[Types of XSS]:
Stored XSS: The malicious code is stored on the server and displayed to users (e.g., in comments).
Reflected XSS: The malicious code is sent in the request and displayed immediately in the response.
DOM XSS: Execution occurs entirely on the client-side, where the DOM is manipulated without direct server involvement.

Now I have this vulnerability, and it's easy to detect if it's present. Here's how you can identify it: this vulnerability is simple to detect, and if discovered by a skilled individual, it can be exploited further. This vulnerability is called HTML Reflected.

To find it, look for a search bar, enter a word, and see if the same word is reflected in the response or not. For example:

<b>gggggg</b>

This code will make the returned word bold. If the word is returned exactly as it was entered, you should:

1. Click on Inspect.
2. Look at the response or search field area.

If you see the code exactly as you entered it, it means the vulnerability exists and can be exploited.

How to Exploit It (Simple Example):

<a href="https://www.amazon.com">click here</a>

This code will return "click here" in the response, and if clicked, it will redirect to another page. This demonstrates the danger of this vulnerability.

Stored XSS: The malicious code is permanently stored on the site and is often found in comment sections, like when you visit a product page with a comment feature.

To test for it, post something like:
<b>rgrg</b>

If you see the text in bold, it indicates a vulnerability. You can then test with:
<script>alert("hello")</script>

If something happens, like an alert box appearing, the vulnerability is confirmed.

DOM XSS
This type can compromise the server or the website.

Example for Testing:
The first lab today involves checking the feedback (feedback form).
1. Look at the URL to see if there is an = symbol and a hyphen -. 
2. Remove the hyphen, add any word, and open Inspect to check if the word is present in the code.

If it‚Äôs there, replace the hyphen with malicious code like:
javascript:alert("hacked");

HTML XSS Testing
If you don‚Äôt see the response in bold, go to Inspect, write the code, and check where it is applied. If you see the code in the search section, it‚Äôs likely safe. However, if it‚Äôs in the image search section, it can be exploited.

For example, test with:
"><script>alert(1);</script>

Or
" onload=alert(3)>

These codes trick the search into allowing script execution.

Bypassing Strong Filters
If strong protections are in place, try inputting any word and search for it in Inspect. If you find something like this:
var message = `0 search results for 'asd'`

You can try injecting this:
${alert(1)}

Filter Bypass Technique 2
If the above method doesn‚Äôt work, you can use techniques to confuse the server. For example:
';alert(1);//

Testing Weakness in Modern Frameworks
If the site is using modern frameworks like AngularJS, you can look for bypasses specific to these technologies. For example:
{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}

Advanced Security Bypass
If JavaScript is blocked by the site, and you see protections like Content-Security-Policy with 'self' in the header, you can bypass this with specific payloads.

Example URL modification:
1. Add this at the end of the URL:
&token=;script-src-elem 'unsafe-inline'

General Notes for XSS Testing:
Tools to Use:
- Use plugins like Wappalyzer to gather information about the site‚Äôs technologies.
- Use Burp Suite for intercepting and modifying requests.

Ethical Testing:
- Only perform these tests in environments where you have explicit permission.
- Platforms like PortSwigger Labs are great for practice.

Learning Resources:
- Explore cheat sheets and tutorials to improve your understanding of advanced XSS techniques.
